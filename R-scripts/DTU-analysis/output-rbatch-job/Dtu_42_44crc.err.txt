Step 1 of 10: Checking data...
Step 2 of 10: Obtaining annotation...
    importing GTF (this may take a while)...
    108166 ( 21.33%) isoforms were removed since they were not expressed in any samples.
Step 3 of 10: Fixing StringTie gene annoation problems...
    There were no need to rescue any annotation
    58752 genes_id were assigned their original gene_id instead of the StringTie gene_id.
        This was only done when it could be done unambiguous.
Step 4 of 10: Calculating expression estimates from count data...
    Skipped as user supplied expression via the "isoformRepExpression" argument...
Step 5 of 10: Testing for unwanted effects...
    Data was not corrected for unwanted effects
Step 6 of 10: Batch correcting expression estimates...
    Skipped as no batch effects were found or annoated...
Step 7 of 10: Extracting data from each condition...
Step 8 of 10: Making comparisons...
Step 9 of 10: Making switchAnalyzeRlist object...
Step 10 of 10: Guestimating differential usage...
    The GUESSTIMATED number of genes with differential isoform usage are:
Done

Warning messages:
1: In importRdata(isoformCountMatrix = salmonQuant$counts, isoformRepExpression = salmonQuant$abundance,  :
  The annotation and quantification (count/abundance matrix and isoform annotation) Seem to be slightly different. 
Specifically:
 629 isoforms were only found in the annotation
 
Please make sure this is on purpouse since differences will cause inaccurate quantification and thereby skew all analysis.
 If you have quantified with Salmon this could be normal since it as default only keep one copy of identical sequnces (can be prevented using the --keepDuplicates option)
 We strongly encurage you to go back and figure out why this is the case.


2: In importRdata(isoformCountMatrix = salmonQuant$counts, isoformRepExpression = salmonQuant$abundance,  :
  
We found MANY unwanted effects in your dataset!
To many for IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR to be trusted with the correction.
We therefore highly reccomend you run sva yourself and add
the nessesary surrogate variables as extra columns in the "designMatrix"

3: In createSwitchAnalyzeRlist(isoformFeatures = isoAnnot, exons = isoformExonStructure,  :
  The gene_ids or isoform_ids were not unique - we identified multiple instances of the same gene_id/isoform_id on different chromosomes. To solve this we removed 16 gene_id. Please note there might still be duplicated gene_id located on the same chromosome. Some of these could be due to fusion transcripts which IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR cannot handle.
The filtering removed 279381 ( 70.1% of ) transcripts. There is now 119137 isoforms left
