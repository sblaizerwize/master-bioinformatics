To let nf-core build the kallisto .idx file, download from ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) the following files:

fasta: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
gtf: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.115.gtf.gz

The goal is to pass on this information to nf-core using the params-rnaseq.yaml file:

fasta: "data/genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz"
gtf: "data/genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.115.chr.gtf.gz"
pseudo_aligner: "kallisto"
save_reference: true

After the nf pipeline successfully runs, you'll find the results at: 
results/genome/index

Alternatively, you can build the kallisto.idx file by running the kallisto_build.slurm file as a batch job.
