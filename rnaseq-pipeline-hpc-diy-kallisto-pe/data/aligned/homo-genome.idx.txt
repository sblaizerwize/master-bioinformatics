To build the index file used by Kallisto you can check detailed instructions at Pseudoalignment with Kallisto (https://protocols.hostmicrobe.org/compute/kallisto#block-cc0b615820d441548f7cd51fbc625d5a). 

Briefly,

- Go to Ensemble (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)
- In the Single species data section, locate the cDNA(FASTA) column corresponding the Human Homo sapiens Species
- Click on FASTA and download the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz file 
- Uncompress the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz file to obtain the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa file
- In the terminal, use Kallisto to build index from reference fasta, see Pseudoalignment with Kallisto (https://protocols.hostmicrobe.org/compute/kallisto#block-cc0b615820d441548f7cd51fbc625d5a).
  >> kallisto index -i Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.index Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa
  After around 15 min you will obtain the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.index file 
- Rename the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.index file as homo-genome.index
