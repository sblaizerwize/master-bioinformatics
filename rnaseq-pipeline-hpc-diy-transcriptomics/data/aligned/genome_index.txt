To build the index file used by HISAT2 you can check detailed instructions at Create the Hisat2 genome index files (https://training.nextflow.io/latest/nf4_science/rnaseq/01_method/#23-create-the-hisat2-genome-index-files)

Briefly,

- Go to Ensemble (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)
- In the Single species data section, locate the cDNA(FASTA) column corresponding the Human Homo sapiens Species
- Click on FASTA and download the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz file 
- Uncompress the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz file to obtain the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa file
- In the terminal, use hisat2 to build index from reference fasta.
  >> hisat2-build Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa genome_index
  After around 40 min you will obtain multiple genome index files. 
- Run the following command to find them in the working directory:
  >> ls genome_index.*
- Store the genome index files in a single file:
  >> tar -czvf genome_index.tar.gz genome_index.*
