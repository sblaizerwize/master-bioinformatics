  abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

  abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing increases the complexity of the proteome that can be generated from the available genomic coding sequences. Dysregulation of the splicing process has been implicated in a vast repertoire of diseases. However, splicing has recently been linked to both the aging process itself and pro-longevity interventions. This review focuses on recent research towards defining RNA splicing as a new hallmark of aging. We highlight dysfunctional alternative splicing events that contribute to the aging phenotype across multiple species, along with recent efforts toward deciphering mechanistic roles for RNA splicing in the regulation of aging and longevity. Further, we discuss recent research demonstrating a direct requirement for specific splicing factors in pro-longevity interventions, and specifically how nutrient signaling pathways interface to splicing factor regulation and downstream splicing targets. Finally, we review the emerging potential of using splicing profiles as a predictor of biological age and life expectancy. Understanding the role of RNA splicing components and downstream targets altered in aging may provide opportunities to develop therapeutics and ultimately extend healthy lifespan in humans.},

Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of 2,023 CRC samples from participants in the UK 100,000 Genomes Project, thereby providing a highly detailed somatic mutational landscape of this cancer. Integrated analyses identify more than 250 putative CRC driver genes, many not previously implicated in CRC or other cancers, including several recurrent changes outside the coding genome. We extend the molecular pathways involved in CRC development, define four new common subgroups of microsatellite-stable CRC based on genomic features and show that these groups have independent prognostic associations. We also characterize several rare molecular CRC subgroups, some with potential clinical relevance, including cancers with both microsatellite and chromosomal instability. We demonstrate a spectrum of mutational profiles across the colorectum, which reflect aetiological differences. These include the role of Escherichia colipks+ colibactin in rectal cancers10 and the importance of the SBS93 signature11--13, which suggests that diet or smoking is a risk factor. Immune-escape driver mutations14 are near-ubiquitous in hypermutant tumours and occur in about half of microsatellite-stable CRCs, often in the form of HLA copy number changes. Many driver mutations are actionable, including those associated with rare subgroups (for example, BRCA1 and IDH1), highlighting the role of whole-genome sequencing in optimizing patient care.},

We also introduce several new informative representations of RNA structure types to improve structure visualization and interpretation. We have further used bpRNA to generate a web-accessible meta-database, `bpRNA-1m', of over 100 000 single-molecule, known secondary structures; this is both more fully and accurately annotated and over 20-times larger than existing databases. We use a subset of the database with highly similar ({$\geq$}90\% identical) sequences filtered out to report on statistical trends in sequence, flanking base pairs, and length.

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the second common cause of death worldwide. Lamin B2 (LMNB2) is involved in chromatin remodeling and the rupture and reorganization of nuclear membrane during mitosis, which is necessary for eukaryotic cell proliferation. However, the role of LMNB2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly understood. This study explored the biological functions of LMNB2 in the progression of colorectal cancer and explored the possible molecular mechanisms. We found that LMNB2 was significantly upregulated in primary colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines, compared with paired non-cancerous tissues and normal colorectal epithelium. The high expression of LMNB2 in colorectal cancer tissues is significantly related to the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients and the shorter overall and disease-free cumulative survival. Functional analysis, including CCK8 cell proliferation test, EdU proliferation test, colony formation analysis, nude mouse xenograft, cell cycle, and apoptosis analysis showed that LMNB2 significantly promotes cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression in vivo and in vitro. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis, luciferase report analysis, and CHIP analysis showed that LMNB2 promotes cell proliferation by regulating the p21 promoter, whereas LMNB2 has no effect on cell apoptosis. In summary, these findings not only indicate that LMNB2 promotes the proliferation of colorectal cancer by regulating p21-mediated cell cycle progression, but also suggest the potential value of LMNB2 as a clinical prognostic marker and molecular therapy target.},

Early onset ({$\leq$}50 y old) and late onset ({$\geq$}65 y old) CRC appear to have differences in their clinicopathological and genetic features, but it is unclear if there are differences in the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that the immune microenvironment of early onset CRC is distinct from late onset CRC and promotes tumor progression. We used NanoString immune profiling to analyze mRNA expression of immune genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from patients with early (n = 40) and late onset (n = 39) CRC. We found three genes, SAA1, C7, and CFD, have increased expression in early onset CRC and distinct immune signatures based on the tumor location. After adjusting for clinicopathological features, increased expression of CFD and SAA1 were associated with worse progression-free survival, and increased expression of C7 was associated with worse overall survival. We also performed gain-of-function experiments with CFD and SAA1 in s.c. tumor models and found that CFD is associated with higher tumor volumes, impacted several immune genes, and impacted three genes in mice that were also found to be differentially expressed in early onset CRC (EGR1, PSMB9, and CXCL9). Our data demonstrate that the immune microenvironment, characterized by a distinct innate immune response signature in early onset CRC, is unique, location dependent, and might contribute to worse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) ({$<$}50 years) incidence has increased in Australia and worldwide. However, the diagnosis of EOCRC is often delayed. Recent research has discovered some differences from later-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC) ({$>$}50 years). An awareness of the unique features of EOCRC is crucial to reduce time from symptom onset to diagnosis. Methods A literature search was conducted on electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) using the search terms ``early onset colorectal cancer'' or ``young onset colorectal cancer.'' Results The American Cancer Society has reduced the colorectal cancer screening initiation age to 45 for average-risk adults whilst screening programmes in the United Kingdom and Australia remain unchanged with initiation at 60 and 50, respectively. Exposures resulting in dysbiosis (obesity, westernised diet, alcohol, antibiotic and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption) have been linked with increased EOCRC risk. EOCRC is often left-sided presenting with rectal bleeding, altered bowel habit and constitutional symptoms. EOCRC is more commonly sporadic than hereditary, harbouring different genetic mutations than LOCRC. Comparative survival outcomes of EOCRC and LOCRC are conflicting with studies suggesting either better or poorer survival. Young patients better tolerate treatment-related toxicities, which may account for their improved survival despite comparatively advanced stages and poorer histopathological features at diagnosis. Conclusion Current EOCRC literature is limited by American-focused datasets and heterogenous EOCRC definitions and study designs (the greatest strength of evidence exists for EOCRC risk factor studies comprised of large retrospective cohorts). There is minimal research into the quality of life and surgical outcomes of EOCRC patients, and this area warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {The expression of the secreted factor Wnt-11 is elevated in several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, where it promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. Analysis of colorectal cancer gene expression databases associated WNT11 mRNA expression with increased likelihood of metastasis in a subset of patients. WNT11 expression was correlated with the expression of the Wnt receptors FZD6, RYK, and PTK7, and the combined expression of WNT11, FZD6 and RYK or PTK7 was associated with an increased risk of 5-year mortality rates. Immunohistochemical analysis of Wnt-11 in a cohort of 357 colorectal cancer patients found significantly higher Wnt-11 levels in tumors, compared with benign tissue. Elevated Wnt-11 levels occurred more frequently in rectal tumors than in colonic tumors and in tumors from women than men. In univariate analysis, increased Wnt-11 expression was also associated with tumor invasion and increased 5-year mortality. High Wnt-11 levels were not associated with high levels of nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin, suggesting Wnt-11 is not simply an indicator for activation of {$\beta$}-catenin-dependent signaling. Expression of Wnt-11 in colorectal cancer cell lines expressing low endogenous Wnt-11 inhibited {$\beta$}-catenin/Tcf activity and increased ATF2-dependent transcriptional activity. WNT11 gene silencing and antibody-mediated inhibition of Wnt-11 in colorectal cancer cell lines expressing high Wnt-11 reduced their capacity for invasion. Together, these observations suggest that Wnt-11 could be a potential target for the treatment of patients with invasive colorectal cancer.},

Here, we identify dysregulated RNA splicing as a key driver of tumour cell dedifferentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC). We find that Apc-deficient CRC cells have dysregulated RNA splicing machinery and exhibit global rewiring of RNA splicing. We show that the splicing factor SRSF1 controls the plasticity of tumour cells by controlling Kras splicing and is required for CRC invasion in a mouse model of carcinogenesis. SRSF1 expression maintains stemness in human CRC organoids and correlates with cancer stem cell marker expression in human tumours. Crucially, partial genetic downregulation of Srsf1 does not detrimentally affect normal tissue homeostasis, demonstrating that tumour cell plasticity can be differentially targeted. Thus, our findings link dysregulation of the RNA splicing machinery and control of tumour cell plasticity.},

  abstract = {Background Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has been increasing in incidence worldwide but its genomic pathogenesis is mostly undetermined. This study aimed to identify robust EOCRC-specific gene expression patterns in non-familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) EOCRC. Method We first performed gene expression profiling analysis using RNA sequencing of discovery cohort comprised of 49 EOCRC (age {$<$}50) and 50 late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC) (age {$>$}70) specimens. To obtain robust gene expression data from this analysis, we validated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through TCGA cohort (EOCRC:59 samples, LOCRC:229 samples) and our validation cohort (EOCRC:72 samples, LOCRC:43 samples) using real-time RT-PCR. After the validation of DEGs, we validated the selected gene at protein levels using Western blotting. To identify whether genomic methylation regulates the expression of a particular gene, we selected methylation sites using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and validated them by pyrosequencing in our validation cohort. Results The EOCRC patients included in this study had significantly more prominent family history of cancer than the LOCRC patients (23 [46.9\%] vs. 13 [26\%], p = 0.050). Alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) was significantly downregulated in the EOCRC tissues (FC = 1.78, p = 0.0007) and was also commonly downregulated in the TCGA cohort (FC = -1.08, p = 0.0021). Moreover, the ANPEP mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly downregulated in the EOCRC tissues of our validation cohort (p = 0.037 and 0.027). In comparisons of the normal and tumor tissues in public datasets, the ANPEP level was significantly lower in the tumor tissue in the TCGA dataset (p {$<$} 2.2 \texttimes{} 10-16) and GSE196006 dataset (p = 0.0005). Furthermore, the ANPEP expression level did not show a decreasing tendency at a young age in the normal colon tissue of the GTEx dataset. Lastly, the hypermethylation of cg26222247 in ANPEP was identified to be weakly associated with reduced ANPEP expression in our EOCRC cohort. Conclusion The reduced expression of ANPEP was identified as a novel biomarker of non-FAP and non-HNPCC EOCRC.},

Here, we discovered that the lncRNA \emph{HOXB-AS3} encodes a conserved 53-aa peptide. The HOXB-AS3 peptide, not lncRNA, suppresses colon cancer (CRC) growth. Mechanistically, the HOXB-AS3 peptide competitively binds to the ariginine residues in RGG motif of hnRNP A1 and antagonizes the hnRNP A1-mediated regulation of pyruvate kinase M (PKM) splicing by blocking the binding of the ariginine residues in RGG motif of hnRNP A1 to the sequences flanking \emph{PKM} exon 9, ensuring the formation of lower PKM2 and suppressing glucose metabolism reprogramming. CRC patients with low levels of HOXB-AS3 peptide have poorer prognoses. Our study indicates that the loss of HOXB-AS3 peptide is a critical oncogenic event in CRC metabolic reprogramming. Our findings uncover a complex regulatory mechanism of cancer metabolism reprogramming orchestrated by a peptide encoded by an lncRNA.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression is a critical link between genotype and phenotype explaining substantial heritable variation within species. However, we are only beginning to understand the ways that specific gene regulatory mechanisms contribute to adaptive divergence of populations. In plants, the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of alternative splicing (AS) plays an important role in both development and abiotic stress response, making it a compelling potential target of natural selection. AS allows organisms to generate multiple different transcripts/proteins from a single gene and thus may provide a source of evolutionary novelty. Here, we examine whether variation in alternative splicing and gene expression levels might contribute to adaptation and incipient speciation of dune-adapted prairie sunflowers in Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado, USA. We conducted a common garden experiment to assess transcriptomic variation among ecotypes and analyzed differential expression, differential splicing, and gene coexpression. We show that individual genes are strongly differentiated for both transcript level and alternative isoform proportions, even when grown in a common environment, and that gene coexpression networks are disrupted between ecotypes. Furthermore, we examined how genome-wide patterns of sequence divergence correspond to divergence in transcript levels and isoform proportions and find evidence for both cis and trans-regulation. Together, our results emphasize that alternative splicing has been an underappreciated mechanism providing source material for natural selection at short evolutionary time scales.},

Understanding the dynamics of tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments. We find that WNT11 promoted CD8+ T-cell exclusion and suppression, which was correlated with poor prognosis in LM. Mechanistically, WNT11-overexpressing tumor cells directly reduce CD8+ T-cell recruitment and activity by decreasing CXCL10 and CCL4 expression through CAMKII-mediated {$\beta$}-catenin/AFF3 downregulation. WNT11-overexpressing tumor cells promote immunosuppressive macrophage polarization by inducing IL17D expression via the CAMKII/NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway, which result in CD8+ T-cell suppression. Moreover, CAMKII inhibition increases the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse model of LM. Serum expression of WNT11 is identified as a potential minimally invasive biomarker in the management of colorectal cancer-LM with immunotherapy. Our findings highlight WNT11/CAMKII axis as a critical regulator of the TME and a promising target for immunotherapy in patients with LM.},

Many diseases are either caused by alterations in AS or by alterations to AS. Therefore, measuring AS accurately and efficiently is critical for assessing molecular phenotypes, including those associated with disease. Long-read sequencing enables more accurate quantification of differentially spliced isoform expression than short-read sequencing approaches, and third-generation platforms facilitate high-throughput experiments. To assess differences in AS across the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum by sex, we generated and analyzed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read RNA sequencing (lrRNA-Seq) C57BL/6J mouse brain cDNA libraries. From {$>$}\,85~million reads that passed quality control metrics, we calculated differential gene expression (DGE), differential transcript expression (DTE), and differential transcript usage (DTU) across brain regions and by sex. We found significant DGE, DTE, and DTU across brain regions and that the cerebellum had the most differences compared to the other three regions. Additionally, we found region-specific differential splicing between sexes, with the most sex differences in DTU in the cortex and no DTU in the hippocampus. We also report on two distinct patterns of sex DTU we observed, sex-divergent and sex-specific, that could potentially help explain sex differences in the prevalence and prognosis of various neurological and psychiatric disorders in future studies. Finally, we built a Shiny web application for researchers to explore the data further. Our study provides a resource for the community; it underscores the importance of AS in biological heterogeneity and the utility of long-read sequencing to better understand AS in the brain.},

For this study, the data was collected from ArrayExpress, followed by preprocessing and subsequent mapping from HISAT2. Read quantification was performed by StringTie and then R package ballgown was used to perform differential expression analysis. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using EnrichR and then immune genes were shortlisted based on the ScType marker database. Furthermore isoform switch analysis was performed using isoformSwitchAnalyzeR package. A total of 9,771 differentially expressed genes were identified and among them 86 were upregulated and 117 were downregulated. Six genes were identified to be mainly associated with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer while a novel set of ten genes were found which have not been reported in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer previously. Moreover, alternative splicing and subsequent isoform usage in the immune system related genes were determined.

  abstract = {Objective The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is steadily increasing. Here, we aimed to characterise the interactions between gut microbiome, metabolites and microbial enzymes in EO-CRC patients and evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for EO-CRC. Design We performed metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, identified multiomics markers and constructed CRC classifiers for the discovery cohort with 130 late-onset CRC (LO-CRC), 114 EO-CRC subjects and age-matched healthy controls (97 LO-Control and 100 EO-Control). An independent cohort of 38 LO-CRC, 24 EO-CRC, 22 LO-Controls and 24 EO-Controls was analysed to validate the results. Results Compared with controls, reduced alpha-diversity was apparent in both, LO-CRC and EO-CRC subjects. Although common variations existed, integrative analyses identified distinct microbiome--metabolome associations in LO-CRC and EO-CRC. Fusobacterium nucleatum enrichment and short-chain fatty acid depletion, including reduced microbial GABA biosynthesis and a shift in acetate/acetaldehyde metabolism towards acetyl-CoA production characterises LO-CRC. In comparison, multiomics signatures of EO-CRC tended to be associated with enriched Flavonifractor plauti and increased tryptophan, bile acid and choline metabolism. Notably, elevated red meat intake-related species, choline metabolites and KEGG orthology (KO) pldB and cbh gene axis may be potential tumour stimulators in EO-CRC. The predictive model based on metagenomic, metabolomic and KO gene markers achieved a powerful classification performance for distinguishing EO-CRC from controls. Conclusion Our large-sample multiomics data suggest that altered microbiome--metabolome interplay helps explain the pathogenesis of EO-CRC and LO-CRC. The potential of microbiome-derived biomarkers as promising non-invasive tools could be used for the accurate detection and distinction of individuals with EO-CRC.},

However, accurate RNA structure prediction from sequence remains a crucial challenge. We introduce DRfold2, a deep learning framework that integrates a novel pre-trained RNA Composite Language Model (RCLM) with a denoising structure module for end-to-end RNA structure prediction. DRfold2 achieves superior performance in both global topology and secondary structure predictions over other state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark tests. Detailed analyses reveal that the improvements primarily stem from the RCLM's ability to capture co-evolutionary pattern and the effective denoising process, leading to a more than 100\% increase in contact prediction precision compared to existing methods. Furthermore, DRfold2 demonstrates high complementarity with AlphaFold3, achieving statistically significant accuracy gains when integrated into our optimization framework. By uniquely combining composite language modeling, denoise-based end-to-end learning, and deep learning-guided post-optimization, DRfold2 establishes a distinct direction for advancing ab initio RNA structure prediction.},

  abstract = {The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC, in patients younger than 50) is increasing worldwide. The specific gene signatures in EO-CRC patients are largely unknown. Since EO-CRC with microsatellite instability is frequently associated with Lynch syndrome, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME) and gene expression profiles of EO-CRC with microsatellite stable (MSS-EO-CRC). Here, we demonstrated that MSS-EO-CRC has a similar pattern of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, immunotherapeutic responses, consensus molecular subtypes, and prognosis as late-onset CRC with MSS (MSS-LO-CRC). 133 differential expressed genes were identified as unique gene signatures of MSS-EO-CRC. Moreover, we established a risk score, which was positively associated with PD-L1 expression and could reflect both the level of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the prognosis of MSS-EO-CRC patients. Application of this score on the anti-PD-L1 treatment cohort demonstrated that the low-risk score group has significant therapeutic advantages and clinical benefits. In addition, candidate driver genes were identified in the different-sidedness of MSS-EO-CRC patients. Altogether, MSS-EO-CRC exhibits distinct molecular profiles that differ from MSS-LO-CRC even though they have a similar TME characterization and survival pattern. Our risk score appears to be robust enough to predict prognosis and immunotherapeutic response and therefore could help to optimize the treatment of MSS-EO-CRC.},

Colorectal cancer is both a common and deadly cancer; being the third most common in incidence and second most common cause of cancer-related death. While systemic therapy remains the primary therapeutic option for most patients with stage IV (metastatic; m) CRC, their disease eventually becomes treatment refractory, and 85\% succumb within 5 years. Microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC tumors, which constitute more than 90\% of patients with mCRC, are generally refractory to immunotherapeutic interventions. In our current work, we characterize MSLN levels in CRC, specifically correlating expression with clinical outcomes in relevant CRC subtypes, and explore how MSLN expression impacts the status of immune activation and suppression in the peritumoral microenvironment. Higher MSLN expression is prevalent in CMS1 and CMS4 CRC subtypes and correlates with higher gene mutation rates across the patient cohorts. Further, MSLN-high patients exhibit increased M1/M2 macrophage infiltration, PD-L1 staining, immune-inhibitory gene expression, enrichment in inflammatory, TGF-{$\beta$}, IL6/JAK/STAT3, IL2/STAT5 signaling pathways, and mutation in KRAS and FBXW7. Together, these results suggest that MSLN protein is a potential target for antigen-specific therapy and supports investigation into its tumorigenic effects to identify possible therapeutic interventions for patients with high MSLN expressing MSS CRC.},

Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the AD pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB), and ROSMAP. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the AD pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk RNAseq to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of AD patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the AD causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze RNAseq data in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, genes are frequently interrupted with noncoding sequences named introns. Alternative splicing is a nuclear mechanism by which these introns are removed and flanking coding regions named exons are joined together to generate a message that will be translated in the cytoplasm. This mechanism is catalyzed by a complex machinery known as the spliceosome, which is conformed by more than 300 proteins and ribonucleoproteins that activate and regulate the precision of gene expression when assembled. It has been proposed that several genetic diseases are related to defects in the splicing process, including cancer. For this reason, natural products that show the ability to regulate splicing have attracted enormous attention due to its potential use for cancer treatment. Some microbial metabolites have shown the ability to inhibit gene splicing and the molecular mechanism responsible for this inhibition is being studied for future applications. Here, we summarize the main types of natural products that have been characterized as splicing inhibitors, the recent advances regarding molecular and cellular effects related to these molecules, and the applications reported so far in cancer therapeutics.},

Identifying differences in gene expression profiles, or transcriptomes, in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC,  50 years old) patients is one approach to understanding molecular and genetic features that distinguish EOCRC.We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of patientmatched tumors and adjacent, uninvolved (normal) colonic segments from EOCRC (n=21) and LOCRC (n=22) patients. The EOCRC and LOCRC cohorts were matched for demographic and clinical characteristics. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) database for validation. We used a series of computational and bioinformatic tools to identify EOCRC-specific differentially expressed genes, molecular pathways, predicted cell populations, differential gene splicing events, and predicted neoantigens.We identified an eight-gene signature in EOCRC comprised of ALDOB, FBXL16, IL1RN, MSLN, RAC3, SLC38A11, WBSCR27 and WNT11, from which we developed a score predictive of overall CRC patient survival. On the entire set of genes identified in normal tissues and tumors, cell type deconvolution analysis predicted a differential abundance of immune and non-immune populations in EOCRC versus LOCRC. Gene set enrichment analysis identified increased expression of splicing machinery in EOCRC. We further found differences in alternative splicing (AS) events, including one within the long non-coding RNA, HOTAIRM1. Additional analysis of AS found seven events specific to EOCRC that encode potential neoantigens.Conclusions: Our transcriptome analyses identified genetic and molecular features specific to EOCRC which may inform future screening, development of prognostic indicators, and novel drug targets.},

However, the high heterogeneity of human tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) hampers a clear identification of specific markers of prognostic relevance. To address these issues, we established short-term cultures of TASCs and matched healthy mucosa-associated stromal cells (MASCs) from human primary colon cancers and, upon characterization of their phenotypic and functional profiles in vitro and in vivo, we identified differentially expressed markers by proteomic analysis and evaluated their prognostic significance. TASCs were characterized by higher proliferation and differentiation potential, and enhanced expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers, as compared to MASCs. TASC triggered epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells in vitro and promoted their metastatic spread in vivo, as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model. Proteomic analysis of matched TASCs and MASCs identified a panel of markers preferentially expressed in TASCs. The expression of genes encoding two of them, calponin 1 (CNN1) and tropomyosin beta chain isoform 2 (TPM2), was significantly associated with poor outcome in independent databases and outperformed the prognostic significance of currently proposed TASC markers. The newly identified markers may improve prognostication of primary colon cancers and identification of patients at risk.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, RNA-seq has been used to study alterations in alternative splicing related to several diseases. Bioinformatics workflows used to perform these studies can be divided into two groups, those finding changes in the absolute isoform expression and those studying differential splicing. Many computational methods for transcriptomics analysis have been developed, evaluated and compared; however, there are not enough reports of systematic and objective assessment of processing pipelines as a whole. Moreover, comparative studies have been performed considering separately the changes in absolute or relative isoform expression levels. Consequently, no consensus exists about the best practices and appropriate workflows to analyse alternative and differential splicing. To assist the adequate pipeline choice, we present here a benchmarking of nine commonly used workflows to detect differential isoform expression and splicing. We evaluated the workflows performance over different experimental scenarios where changes in absolute and relative isoform expression occurred simultaneously. In addition, the effect of the number of isoforms per gene, and the magnitude of the expression change over pipeline performances were also evaluated. Our results suggest that workflow performance is influenced by the number of replicates per condition and the conditions heterogeneity. In general, workflows based on DESeq2, DEXSeq, Limma and NOISeq performed well over a wide range of transcriptomics experiments. In particular, we suggest the use of workflows based on Limma when high precision is required, and DESeq2 and DEXseq pipelines to prioritize sensitivity. When several replicates per condition are available, NOISeq and Limma pipelines are indicated.},

  abstract = {To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16\% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase {$\varepsilon$} (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is caused by a sequence of somatic genomic alterations affecting driver genes in core cancer pathways1. Here, to understand the functional and prognostic impact of cancer-causing somatic mutations, we analysed the whole genomes and transcriptomes of 1,063 primary colorectal cancers in a population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. From the 96 mutated driver genes, 9 were not previously implicated in colorectal cancer and 24~had not been linked to any cancer. Two distinct patterns of pathway co-mutations were observed, timing analyses identified nine early and three late driver gene mutations, and several signatures of colorectal-cancer-specific mutational processes were identified. Mutations in WNT, EGFR and TGF{$\beta$} pathway genes, the mitochondrial CYB gene and 3 regulatory elements along with 21 copy-number variations and the COSMIC SBS44 signature correlated with survival. Gene expression classification yielded five prognostic subtypes with distinct molecular features, in part explained by underlying genomic alterations. Microsatellite-instable tumours divided into two classes with different levels of hypoxia and infiltration of immune and stromal cells. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the largest integrated genome and transcriptome analysis of colorectal cancer, and interlinks mutations, gene expression and patient outcomes. The identification of prognostic mutations and expression subtypes can guide future efforts to individualize colorectal cancer therapy.},

Over the years, sequencing technologies have produced an enormous amount of unlabeled RNA data, which hides a huge potential. Motivated by the successes of protein language models, we introduce RiboNucleic Acid Language Model (RiNALMo) to unveil the hidden code of RNA. RiNALMo is the largest RNA language model to date, with 650M parameters pre-trained on 36M non-coding RNA sequences from several databases. It can extract hidden knowledge and capture the underlying structure information implicitly embedded within the RNA sequences. RiNALMo achieves state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks. Notably, we show that its generalization capabilities overcome the inability of other deep learning methods for secondary structure prediction to generalize on unseen RNA families.},

Consequently, the precision of sequence analysis pertaining to RNA secondary structures, such as RNA--protein interactions, has also been enhanced, making a substantial contribution to the field of RNA biology. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning are also introducing technical innovations in the analysis of RNA--small molecule interactions for RNA-targeted drug discovery and in the design of RNA aptamers, where RNA serves as its own ligand.

Intersecting identified DEGs with the module with the highest correlation to gene expression patterns of tumor samples in the gene co-expression network analysis revealed 283 overlapped genes. Centrality measures were calculated for these genes in the reconstructed STRING protein--protein interaction network. Applying LASSO logistic regression, eleven genes were ultimately recognized as candidate diagnostic genes. Among these genes, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values for nine genes (CDC25B, CDK4, IQGAP3, MMP1, MMP7, SLC7A5, TEAD4, TRIB3, and UHRF1) surpassed the threshold of 0.92 in both the training and validation sets. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these genes with four machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). In the testing dataset (GSE21815 and GSE106582), the AUROC scores were greater than 0.95 for all of the machine learning algorithms, indicating the high diagnostic performance of the nine genes. Besides, these nine genes are also significantly correlated to twelve immune cells, namely Mast cells activated, Macrophages M0, M1, and M2, Neutrophils, T cells CD4 memory activated, T cells follicular helper, T cells CD8, T cells CD4 memory resting, B cells memory, Plasma cells, and Mast cells resting (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). These results strongly suggest that all of the nine genes have the potential to serve as reliable diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.},

Although RNA structure is key to function, many foundational characteristics of RNA structure are misunderstood, and the default state of RNA is often thought of and depicted as a single floppy strand. The purpose of this perspective is to help adjust mental models, equipping the community to better use the fundamental aspects of RNA structural information in new mechanistic models, enhance experimental design to test these models, and refine data interpretation. We discuss six core observations focused on the inherent nature of RNA structure and how to incorporate these characteristics to better understand RNA structure. We also offer some ideas for future efforts to make validated RNA structural information available and readily used by all researchers.},

For this, we identified 704 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by intersecting three datasets, GSE41328, GSE37364, and GSE15960 from Gene Expression Omnibus database, to maximize the accuracy of the results. Preliminary analysis of the DEGs was then performed using online gene analysis datasets, such as DAVID, UCSC Cancer Genome Browser, CBioPortal, STRING, and UCSC Cancer Genome Browser. Cytoscape was utilized to visualize the protein perception interaction network of DEGs, and the bubble map of GO and KEGG enrichment function was demonstrated using the R package. The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), Biological Network Gene Oncology (BiNGO) plug-in in Cytoscape, was applied to further screen the DEGs to obtain 15 seed genes, which were IL1RN, GALNT12, ADH6, SCN7A, CXCL1, FGF18, SOX9, ACACB, PRRX1, MZB1, SLC22A3, CNNM4, LY6E, IFITM2, and GDPD3. Among them, IL1RN, ADH6, SCN7A, ACACB, MZB1, and GDPD3 exhibited statistically significant survival differences, whereas limited studies were conducted in CRC. Based on the enrichment results of the ``Gene Ontology``(GO) and ``Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and genomes ``(KEGG) as well as documented findings of key genes, we further emphasized the potential of IL1RN and PRRX1 as markers of immune infiltrates in CRC and confirmed our hypothesis by compiling data from the UALCAN, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, and TISIDB databases for these two genes. The above-mentioned genes might offer a valuable insight into the diagnosis, immunotherapeutic targets, and prognosis of CRC.},

The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/\textasciitilde wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments of length n {$\geq$} 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and found compelling evidence for many other conserved RNA secondary structures not described so far to our knowledge.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~           Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Early onset colorectal cancer (age {$\leq$}45 y) is increasing and associated with advanced disease. Although distinct molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer have been characterized, it is unclear whether age-related molecular differences exist.           OBJECTIVE:~           We sought to identify differences in gene expression between early and late-onset (age {$\geq$}65 y) colorectal cancer.           DESIGN:~           We performed a review of our institution's colorectal cancer registry and identified patients with colorectal cancer with tissue specimens available for analysis. We used the Cancer Genome Atlas to initially identify differences in gene expression between early and late-onset colorectal cancer. In vitro experiments were performed on 2 colorectal cancer cell lines.           SETTINGS:~           The study was conducted at a tertiary medical center.           PATIENTS:~           Patients with early onset (n = 28) or late onset (age {$\geq$}65 y; n = 38) at time of diagnosis were included.           MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:~           The primary outcome was differential gene expression in patients with early versus late-onset colorectal cancer. The secondary outcome was patient mortality.           RESULTS:~           Seven genes had increased expression in younger patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas. Only PEG10 was sufficiently expressed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and had increased expression in our early onset group. Multivariable linear regression analysis identified age as a significant independent predictor of increased PEG10 expression. Outcomes data from The Cancer Genome Atlas suggests that PEG10 is associated with poor overall survival. In vitro studies in HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines showed that PEG10 contributes to cellular proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer.           LIMITATIONS:~           Tissue samples were from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Many patients did not have mutational status for review.           CONCLUSIONS:~           PEG10 is differentially expressed in early onset colorectal cancer and may functionally contribute to tumor cell proliferation and invasion. An increase in PEG10 expression correlates with decreased overall survival. See Video Abstract at https://links.lww.com/DCR/B343.           LA EXPRESI\'ON DIFERENCIAL DE PEG10 CONTRIBUYE A LA ENFERMEDAD AGRESIVA EN EL C\'ANCER COLORRECTAL DE INICIO TEMPRANO VERSUS INICIO TARD\'IO~           ANTECEDENTES:           El c\'ancer colorrectal es una de las principales causas de muerte relacionada con el c\'ancer. El c\'ancer colorrectal de inicio temprano (edad {$\leq$}45 a\~nos) est\'a en aumento y asociado con enfermedad avanzada. Aunque se han caracterizado distintos subtipos moleculares del c\'ancer colorrectal, no est\'a claro si existen diferencias moleculares relacionadas con la edad.           OBJETIVO:           Se busc\'o identificar diferencias en la expresi\'on g\'enica entre el c\'ancer colorrectal de inicio temprano y tard\'io (edad {$\geq$} 65 a\~nos).           DISE\~NO:           Realizamos una revisi\'on del registro de c\'ancer colorrectal de nuestra instituci\'on e identificamos pacientes con c\'ancer colorrectal con muestras de tejido disponibles para su an\'alisis. Utilizamos el Atlas del Genoma del C\'ancer para identificar inicialmente las diferencias en la expresi\'on g\'enica entre el c\'ancer colorrectal de inicio temprano y de inicio tard\'io. Se realizaron experimentos in vitro en dos l\'ineas celulares de c\'ancer colorrectal.           AJUSTES:           El estudio se realiz\'o en un centro m\'edico de tercer nivel.           PACIENTES:           Se incluyeron pacientes con inicio temprano (n = 28) e inicio tard\'io (edad {$\geq$}65 a\~nos, n = 38) al momento del diagn\'ostico.           PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:           El resultado primario fue la expresi\'on diferencial de genes en pacientes con c\'ancer colorrectal de inicio temprano versus tard\'io. El resultado secundario fue la mortalidad de los pacientes.           RESULTADOS:           Siete genes aumentaron su expresi\'on en pacientes m\'as j\'ovenes usando el Atlas del Genoma del C\'ancer. Solo PEG10 se expres\'o suficientemente con la reacci\'on en cadena de la polimerasa cuantitativa y tuvo una mayor expresi\'on en nuestro grupo de inicio temprano. El an\'alisis de regresi\'on lineal multivariable identific\'o la edad como un predictor independiente significativo del aumento de la expresi\'on de PEG10. Los datos de resultados de el Atlas del Genoma del C\'ancer sugieren que PEG10 est\'a asociado con una pobre supervivencia general. Los estudios in vitro en l\'ineas celulares HCT-116 y HT-29 mostraron que PEG10 contribuye a la proliferaci\'on e invasi\'on celular en el c\'ancer colorrectal.           LIMITACIONES:           Las muestras de tejido fueron de portaobjetos embebidos en parafina fijados con formalina. Muchos pacientes no ten\'ian el estado de mutaci\'on para su revisi\'on.           CONCLUSIONES:           El PEG10 se expresa diferencialmente en el c\'ancer colorrectal de inicio temprano y puede contribuir funcionalmente a la proliferaci\'on e invasi\'on de c\'elulas tumorales. El aumento en la expresi\'on de PEG10 se correlaciona con la disminuci\'on de la supervivencia general. Consulte Video Resumen en https://links.lww.com/DCR/B343.},

  abstract = {Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is increasing in adults younger than 50 years. This study evaluated clinical and molecular features to identify those features unique to early-onset CRC that differentiate these patients from patients 50 years old or older. Methods Baseline characteristics were evaluated according to the CRC onset age with 3 independent cohorts. A fourth cohort was used to describe the impact of age on the consensus molecular subtype (CMS) prevalence. Results This retrospective review of more than 36,000 patients with CRC showed that early-onset patients were more likely to have microsatellite instability (P = .038), synchronous metastatic disease (P = .009), primary tumors in the distal colon or rectum (P {$<$} .0001), and fewer BRAF V600 mutations (P {$<$} .001) in comparison with patients 50 years old or older. Patients aged 18 to 29 years had fewer adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.90; P = .015) and an increased prevalence of signet ring histology (OR, 4.89; 95\% CI, 3.23-7.39; P {$<$} .0001) in comparison with other patients younger than 50 years. In patients younger than 40 years, CMS1 was the most common subtype, whereas CMS3 and CMS4 were uncommon (P = .003). CMS2 was relatively stable across age groups. Early-onset patients with inflammatory bowel disease were more likely to have mucinous or signet ring histology (OR, 5.54; 95\% CI, 2.24-13.74; P = .0004) and less likely to have APC mutations (OR, 0.24; 95\% CI, 0.07-0.75; P = .019) in comparison with early-onset patients without predisposing conditions. Conclusions Early-onset CRC is not only distinct from traditional CRC: special consideration should be given to and further investigations should be performed for both very young patients with CRC (18-29 years) and those with predisposing conditions. The etiology of the high rate of CMS1 in patients younger than 40 years deserves further exploration.},

It is crucial for this type of tool to use the latest annotation databases for as many organisms as possible. To meet these requirements, we present here an updated version of our popular Bioconductor package, clusterProfiler 4.0. This package has been enhanced considerably compared with its original version published 9 years ago. The new version provides a universal interface for functional enrichment analysis in thousands of organisms based on internally supported ontologies and pathways as well as annotation data provided by users or derived from online databases. It also extends the dplyr and ggplot2 packages to offer tidy interfaces for data operation and visualization. Other new features include gene set enrichment analysis and comparison of enrichment results from multiple gene lists. We anticipate that clusterProfiler 4.0 will be applied to a wide range of scenarios across diverse organisms.},

  abstract = {BackgroundEarly onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is a heterogeneous colorectal cancer subtype with obvious hereditary tendencies and increasing incidence. We sought to determine the susceptibility genes and molecular characteristics of EOCRC.Methods330 EO metastatic CRC (mCRC) ({$\leq$}55 years) and 110 average-onset (AO) mCRC patients (\&gt;55 years) were enrolled. Capture-based targeted sequencing was performed on tumor tissue and paired white blood cells using a sequencing panel of 520 genes. The association between molecular alterations and overall survival (OS) was analyzed.ResultsOf the 330 EO mCRC patients, 31 carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations, with 16 of them diagnosed with lynch syndrome. Fifteen patients had germline mutations in non-mismatch repair genes, including 4 in MUTHY, 3 in RAD50, 1 in TP53, and 8 in other genes. Twenty-nine genes were recurrently mutated in EO mCRC, including TP53, APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and BRCA2. The majority of genomic alterations were comparable between EO and AO mCRC. EO mCRC were more likely to have a high tumor mutation burden (p \&lt; 0.05). RNF43, RBM10, TSC, and BRAF V600E mutations were more commonly observed in EO mCRC, while APC, ASXL1, DNMT3B, and MET genes were more commonly altered in AO patients. At the pathway level, the WNT pathway was the only differentially mutated pathway between EO and AO mCRC (p \&lt; 0.0001). The wild-type WNT pathway (p = 0.0017) and mutated TGF-{$\beta$} pathway (p = 0.023) were associated with unfavorable OS in EO mCRC.ConclusionsApproximately 1 in 10 EO mCRC were associated with hereditary tumors. The spectrum of somatic alterations was largely comparable between EO and AO mCRC with several notable differences.},

  abstract = {Objective Sporadic early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has bad prognosis, yet is poorly represented by cell line models. We examine the key mutational and transcriptomic alterations in an organoid biobank enriched in EOCRCs. Design We established paired cancer (n=32) and normal organoids (n=18) from 20 patients enriched in microsatellite-stable EOCRC. Exome and transcriptome analysis was performed. Results We observed a striking diversity of molecular phenotypes, including PTPRK-RSPO3 fusions. Transcriptionally, RSPO fusion organoids resembled normal colon organoids and were distinct from APC mutant organoids, with high BMP2 and low PTK7 expression. Single cell transcriptome analysis confirmed the similarity between RSPO fusion organoids and normal organoids, with a propensity for maturation on Wnt withdrawal, whereas the APC mutant organoids were locked in progenitor stages. CRISPR/Cas9 engineered mutation of APC in normal human colon organoids led to upregulation of PTK7 protein and suppression of BMP2 , but less so with an engineered RNF43 mutation. The frequent co-occurrence of RSPO fusions with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutation was confirmed in TCGA database searches. RNF43 mutation was found in organoid from a leukaemia survivor with a novel mutational signature; and organoids with POLE proofreading mutation displayed ultramutation. The cancer organoid genomes were stable over long culture periods, while normal human colon organoids tended to be subject to clonal dominance over time. Conclusions These organoid models enriched in EOCRCs with linked genomic data fill a gap in existing CRC models and reveal distinct genetic profiles and novel pathway cooperativity.},

  abstract = {In recent years, inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) for DNA and proteins, several LLMs for RNA have also been developed. These models take massive RNA datasets as inputs and learn, in a self-supervised way, how to represent each RNA base with a semantically rich numerical vector. This is done under the hypothesis that obtaining high-quality RNA representations can enhance data-costly downstream tasks, such as the fundamental RNA secondary structure prediction problem. However, existing RNA-LLM have not been evaluated for this task in a unified experimental setup. Since they are pretrained models, assessment of their generalization capabilities on new structures is a crucial aspect. Nonetheless, this has been just partially addressed in literature. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental and comparative analysis of pretrained RNA-LLM that have been recently proposed. We evaluate the use of these representations for the secondary structure prediction task with a common deep learning architecture. The RNA-LLM were assessed with increasing generalization difficulty on benchmark datasets. Results showed that two LLMs clearly outperform the other models, and revealed significant challenges for generalization in low-homology scenarios. Moreover, in this study we provide curated benchmark datasets of increasing complexity and a unified experimental setup for this scientific endeavor. Source code and curated benchmark datasets with increasing complexity are available in the repository: https://github.com/sinc-lab/rna-llm-folding/.},

Based on molecular features of early-onset CRC, early-onset adenomas are emerging surrogate endpoints.In a prospective cohort study (Nurses' Health Study II), we evaluated 2 empirical dietary patterns (Western and prudent) and 3 recommendation-based indexes (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH], Alternative Mediterranean Diet [AMED], and Alternative Healthy Eating Index [AHEI]-2010) with risk of early-onset adenoma overall and by malignant potential (high-risk: {$\geq$}1\,cm, tubulovillous or villous histology, high-grade dysplasia, or {$\geq$}3 adenomas), among 29 474 women with 1 or more lower endoscopy before age 50 years (1991--2011). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).We documented 1157 early-onset adenomas with 375 at high risk. Western diet was positively associated, whereas prudent diet, DASH, AMED, and AHEI-2010 were inversely associated with risk of early-onset adenoma. The associations were largely confined to high-risk adenomas (the highest vs lowest quintile: Western, OR = 1.67, 95\% CI = 1.18 to 2.37; prudent, OR = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.48 to 0.98; DASH, OR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.45 to 0.93; AMED, OR = 0.55, 95\% CI = 0.38 to 0.79; AHEI-2010,\,OR =\,0.71, 95\% CI = 0.51 to 1.01; all Ptrend {$\leq$} .03), driven by those identified in the distal colon and rectum (all Ptrend {$\leq$} .04, except AMED: Ptrend = .14).Poor diet quality was associated with an increased risk of early-onset distal and rectal adenomas of high malignant potential.
