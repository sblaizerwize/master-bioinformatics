  abstract = {Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of mortality1, but a comprehensive description of its genomic landscape is lacking2--9. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of 2,023 CRC samples from participants in the UK 100,000 Genomes Project, thereby providing a highly detailed somatic mutational landscape of this cancer. Integrated analyses identify more than 250 putative CRC driver genes, many not previously implicated in CRC or other cancers, including several recurrent changes outside the coding genome. We extend the molecular pathways involved in CRC development, define four new common subgroups of microsatellite-stable CRC based on genomic features and show that these groups have independent prognostic associations. We also characterize several rare molecular CRC subgroups, some with potential clinical relevance, including cancers with both microsatellite and chromosomal instability. We demonstrate a spectrum of mutational profiles across the colorectum, which reflect aetiological differences. These include the role of Escherichia colipks+ colibactin in rectal cancers10 and the importance of the SBS93 signature11--13, which suggests that diet or smoking is a risk factor. Immune-escape driver mutations14 are near-ubiquitous in hypermutant tumours and occur in about half of microsatellite-stable CRCs, often in the form of HLA copy number changes. Many driver mutations are actionable, including those associated with rare subgroups (for example, BRCA1 and IDH1), highlighting the role of whole-genome sequencing in optimizing patient care.},

  abstract = {The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been steadily increasing in younger individuals over the past several decades for reasons that are incompletely defined. Identifying differences in gene expression profiles, or transcriptomes, in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC,  50 years old) patients is one approach to understanding molecular and genetic features that distinguish EOCRC.We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of patientmatched tumors and adjacent, uninvolved (normal) colonic segments from EOCRC (n=21) and LOCRC (n=22) patients. The EOCRC and LOCRC cohorts were matched for demographic and clinical characteristics. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) database for validation. We used a series of computational and bioinformatic tools to identify EOCRC-specific differentially expressed genes, molecular pathways, predicted cell populations, differential gene splicing events, and predicted neoantigens.We identified an eight-gene signature in EOCRC comprised of ALDOB, FBXL16, IL1RN, MSLN, RAC3, SLC38A11, WBSCR27 and WNT11, from which we developed a score predictive of overall CRC patient survival. On the entire set of genes identified in normal tissues and tumors, cell type deconvolution analysis predicted a differential abundance of immune and non-immune populations in EOCRC versus LOCRC. Gene set enrichment analysis identified increased expression of splicing machinery in EOCRC. We further found differences in alternative splicing (AS) events, including one within the long non-coding RNA, HOTAIRM1. Additional analysis of AS found seven events specific to EOCRC that encode potential neoantigens.Conclusions: Our transcriptome analyses identified genetic and molecular features specific to EOCRC which may inform future screening, development of prognostic indicators, and novel drug targets.},

  abstract = {To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16\% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase {$\varepsilon$} (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is caused by a sequence of somatic genomic alterations affecting driver genes in core cancer pathways1. Here, to understand the functional and prognostic impact of cancer-causing somatic mutations, we analysed the whole genomes and transcriptomes of 1,063 primary colorectal cancers in a population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. From the 96 mutated driver genes, 9 were not previously implicated in colorectal cancer and 24~had not been linked to any cancer. Two distinct patterns of pathway co-mutations were observed, timing analyses identified nine early and three late driver gene mutations, and several signatures of colorectal-cancer-specific mutational processes were identified. Mutations in WNT, EGFR and TGF{$\beta$} pathway genes, the mitochondrial CYB gene and 3 regulatory elements along with 21 copy-number variations and the COSMIC SBS44 signature correlated with survival. Gene expression classification yielded five prognostic subtypes with distinct molecular features, in part explained by underlying genomic alterations. Microsatellite-instable tumours divided into two classes with different levels of hypoxia and infiltration of immune and stromal cells. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the largest integrated genome and transcriptome analysis of colorectal cancer, and interlinks mutations, gene expression and patient outcomes. The identification of prognostic mutations and expression subtypes can guide future efforts to individualize colorectal cancer therapy.},

This emphasizes the necessity to improve our understanding of its structures and functions. Over the years, sequencing technologies have produced an enormous amount of unlabeled RNA data, which hides a huge potential. Motivated by the successes of protein language models, we introduce RiboNucleic Acid Language Model (RiNALMo) to unveil the hidden code of RNA. RiNALMo is the largest RNA language model to date, with 650M parameters pre-trained on 36M non-coding RNA sequences from several databases. It can extract hidden knowledge and capture the underlying structure information implicitly embedded within the RNA sequences. RiNALMo achieves state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks. Notably, we show that its generalization capabilities overcome the inability of other deep learning methods for secondary structure prediction to generalize on unseen RNA families.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to identify diagnostic gene biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumor and adjacent normal samples across five colon cancer gene-expression profiles (GSE10950, GSE25070, GSE41328, GSE74602, GSE142279) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Intersecting identified DEGs with the module with the highest correlation to gene expression patterns of tumor samples in the gene co-expression network analysis revealed 283 overlapped genes. Centrality measures were calculated for these genes in the reconstructed STRING protein--protein interaction network. Applying LASSO logistic regression, eleven genes were ultimately recognized as candidate diagnostic genes. Among these genes, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values for nine genes (CDC25B, CDK4, IQGAP3, MMP1, MMP7, SLC7A5, TEAD4, TRIB3, and UHRF1) surpassed the threshold of 0.92 in both the training and validation sets. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these genes with four machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). In the testing dataset (GSE21815 and GSE106582), the AUROC scores were greater than 0.95 for all of the machine learning algorithms, indicating the high diagnostic performance of the nine genes. Besides, these nine genes are also significantly correlated to twelve immune cells, namely Mast cells activated, Macrophages M0, M1, and M2, Neutrophils, T cells CD4 memory activated, T cells follicular helper, T cells CD8, T cells CD4 memory resting, B cells memory, Plasma cells, and Mast cells resting (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). These results strongly suggest that all of the nine genes have the potential to serve as reliable diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed {\textasciitilde}140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},
